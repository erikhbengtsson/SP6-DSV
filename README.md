# SP6-DSV
2D platformer game created for a school assignment. The game is divided into a game engine and the actual game. The game engine could, with small modifications, be used for other 2d games.

The objective is to collect all the coins and avoid the balls/bombs.

Controllers are the arrow keys to move and escape to go back to main menu. The mouse is used in the menus.
